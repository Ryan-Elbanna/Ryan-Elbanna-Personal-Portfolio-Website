        <h1>General Information</h1>
        <article class="works-children-centre-content">
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-right">Throughout the year of learning HTML and CSS in web application development, the class was tasked with creating a tourism website. This tourism website started with each of my classmates, including myself, to pick a country of our choosing. I chose Lebanon, because it is my nationality. However, this wasn’t a solo project, 7 total teams were created with each team having 3 students, however, there were two teams that had 4 students. I was in one of the teams with 4 students. Each team had to make a mood board that depicted the theme and feel of the website using Adobe Photoshop or some other program. Every team utilized Figma to wireframe the website and Visual Studio Code along with GitHub Desktop to collaborate and create the website.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-left">While working on the tourism website with my team, my goal was to develop an easy to understand CSS stylesheet and to provide as much information as possible about Lebanon on the website. While achieving these goals I learned concepts such as having to use mood boards to depict the feeling, theme, and overall mood of the website. I also learned more about CSS when developing the tourism website with Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-right">Although there were multiple people working on the tourism website, many challenges were encountered. During development using Visual Studio Code, our CSS for our website would not work properly when using media queries or styling specific elements. When this happened, my team and I did some research on how to counteract these problems, and came up with several solutions. We then took what we got from our research and implemented them into our website. Afterwards everything functioned, and from there we kept on developing.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-left">This project was certainly fun, as I got the chance to create a website dedicated to different countries that included my native country. And so, my team had used the CART Habits of Mind “collaborate”, “communicate”, “reflect”, and “persist”. When wireframing using  Figma and developing using Visual Studio Code, my team and I collaborated and communicated effectively to get work done in a professional and timely manner. Whenever problems came up, we always persisted. We communicated and collaborated to research and fix the problem and then we reflected on the problem after it was fixed to never make the same mistake again.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-right">Overall, this was probably one of my favourite assignments/projects as my team and I did extremely well on making the website work and function as it was intended.</p>
