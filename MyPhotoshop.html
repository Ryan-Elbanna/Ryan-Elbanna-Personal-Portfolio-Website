        <h1>General Information</h1>

        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-right">Something enjoyable and fun I did this year was creating effects on photos and editing photos with Adobe Photoshop. I have never used Adobe Photoshop before, however, I have used other applications similar to it. The reason for editing the images and creating artistic and intricate special effects was for the class to understand the capabilities of Adobe Photoshop, and how powerful it can be used in a website development scenario. By learning to use Adobe Photoshop, I was able to optimize images on my website for less loading time and created custom logos, graphics, etc. with special effects.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-left">Adobe Photoshop provided a fun and creative experience for me to edit photos. As I had a massive amount of tools, options, effects, etc. to choose from. Throughout the usage of Adobe Photoshop, I found specific tools to make images look better or have a certain style. I also found out how to remove backgrounds off of images easily, and I found out simple mechanics to alter images or cut out certain parts of an image and edit them individually.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-right">While editing and having fun with Adobe Photoshop, there were challenges. Some of these challenges ranged from certain edited layers not appearing the way they were supposed to appear. Or sometimes, images would not be able to be edited with the tools I was using sometimes. There were many problems with using Adobe Photoshop for the first time, however, after some time and getting to know how things work in Adobe Photoshop, I was able to edit quite easily. During these challenges I asked my classmates around me for some assistance, which worked out great in the end because I managed to finish what I wanted to accomplish.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-left">To counteract these challenges, I had used the CART Habit of Mind “investigate”, “communicate”, and “reflect”. These challenges helped me communicate with my classmates around me to be able to get some assistance on why something wasn’t working, or if I was doing anything wrong while editing. I looked into and investigated issues, to figure out why certain things are not working. Investigating helped me a lot, and it allowed me to reflect on what I did wrong so that I won’t make the same mistake the next time I try to edit using Adobe Photoshop. However, in the end, there were successes and I now know how to use Adobe Photoshop efficiently and effectively.</p>
