        <h1>General Information</h1>
        <article class="works-children-centre-content">
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-right">One website related thing that I have made this year was an “About Me” website that was made using Adobe Spark. The reason for making this “About Me” website page is to let my classmates and teachers get to know me better by displaying information on friends, family, hobbies, future and life goals, travels and places of interest, and etc. And using Adobe Spark allowed me to design and format the website the way I intended it.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-left">Using the software was fun and quite interesting. Adobe Spark was very easy to use and it was simple. I added images of specific topics and items, and explained it with text. Also, the images that were used had to have the author/creator credited, as they were free use images from other websites. Formatting everything together was a very easy process, as I could either choose from a previously formatted template or just create my own format and go with it. I found it quite fun when it came to adding transitions and text fonts. As on some parts of the “About Me” website I added some subtle transitions that made everything much nicer.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-right">During the development of the “About Me” website page, I enounted troubles such as images not going toward the right places on some specific formats. Also, adding images, text, and other elements were kind of difficult. As elements weren’t snapping to their designated position, or sometimes the elements didn’t even show up at all. These became challenges, but with some time, I managed to get everything to work.</p>
        <p class="aboutslide-in second-about-p-left">During these challenges, I felt annoyed and irritated, however, I didn’t feel like giving up at all. Through the development process, I had employed and learned of the CART Habit of Mind “persist”, “communicate”, and “reflect”. Though there were challenges that appeared during development, I persisted, and continued to develop and finish the website. I also reflected on what I did wrong, and why some things were not working. And so, by using Adobe Spark, I communicated with my classmates and those around me to find a solution. And in the end, I developed a satisfyingly good “About Me” website page that looked good.</p>
