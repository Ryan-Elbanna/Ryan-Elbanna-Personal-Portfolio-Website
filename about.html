        <p>I am a junior at Clovis West High School that attends the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) for Web Application Development. This is my first year at CART taking the Web Application Development lab as a junior, however, in my senior year, I plan to take Interactive Game Design to further expand my knowledge on both Web and Game Development. I am able to speak, read, and write in Arabic, English, and Spanish. During the past years, I have had work experience in a restaurant, and achieved multiple Fresno State Youth Technology Institute certificates over the past summers. I have hobbies such as playing soccer with friends, sharing game and project ideas, and better developing my knowledge of programming.</p>
        <p>A few personal details: Outside of academics and studies, I enjoy many things, including learning new languages. Currently, I am learning Danish because of my interest in Denmark. I really enjoy learning new programming languages too, as I have a passion for making and creating my own things for specific intentions. Programming languages that I am most familiar with are Python, C++, Java, Lua, and JavaScript. However, I plan to expand my knowledge and only pick programming languages that will allow me to pursue my career. On the side of computers and technology, I like to play video games with my friends sometimes, and we usually enjoy thinking about video game ideas and getting to the point of creating a video game as a fun project. Aside from that, I am a huge soccer fan. I enjoy playing soccer all the time, it is my favourite sport and I enjoy watching the FIFA World Cup.</p>
        <p>Not every bit of information from my portfolio is listed on this page. To know more about me, please take a look at the rest of my portfolio, which contains my resume, past works and projects, my cover letter, hobbies, languages, skills, certifications, etc. . If you would like to get in contact with me, I have a LinkedIn page.</p>
